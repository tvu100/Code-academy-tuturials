                        <p>Hey guys! I am Danny, co-founder of CHOMP'D. Through my love for food and adventures, I have decided to visit
                        restaurants where the hard work, creativity and passion from the owners to the chefs are often overlooked. I knew then
                        that I needed to create a platform where I was able to help capture and share the stories of the people involved in our
                        favourite eateries.

                        <p>Lejan here! I absolutely love my food and all the different cuisines from all over the world. One of my favourite things
                        to do is to discover new places to eat at and share them with everyone! But the one love that I will always come back to
                        is home-made cooking.

                        <p>Hey, I am Gaurav! I'm the videographer of CHOMP'D. I love everything to do with filmmaking ranging from the exciting
                        pre-production right through to the creative post-production. I want to transfer my skills into the culinary arts world
                        through visual storytelling of each dish that is prepared — showing the heart and the passion that goes into preparing
                        and serving it.
